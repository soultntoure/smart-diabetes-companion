# Smart Diabetes Companion

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for the "Smart Diabetes Companion," an innovative diabetes management application designed to move beyond basic data logging. It leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and seamless integration with wearable technology to provide proactive, personalized behavioral nudges, aiming to improve glycemic control and enhance user autonomy.

## Problem Statement & Market Gap Addressed

Existing diabetes management apps, such as Glucose Buddy, mySugr, and MyFitnessPal, often fall short in:

*   **Proactive, Contextual Behavioral Support:** They primarily focus on data logging, lacking real-time, personalized advice to prevent glucose excursions.
*   **Broad Wearable Integration:** Many are tied to specific device ecosystems (e.g., mySugr with Accu-Chek), limiting their appeal.
*   **Predictive Capabilities:** They are often reactive rather than predictive of hypo/hyperglycemic events.
*   **User Engagement:** Some struggle with long-term user retention.

This project aims to fill these gaps by offering:

*   **AI-Powered Predictive Analytics:** Forecasting potential glucose excursions.
*   **Contextual Behavioral Nudges:** Delivering specific, timely, and personalized recommendations.
*   **Cross-Platform Wearable Integration:** Acting as a central hub for data from various CGMs and smartwatches.
*   **Focus on User Competence & Autonomy:** Building user confidence through understandable insights.

## Technology Stack Justification

*   **Frontend (React):** Chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easier to build a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface for complex data visualization and interaction. It allows for efficient development of personalized dashboards and nudge interfaces.

*   **Backend (Python with FastAPI):** Python is selected due to its strong ecosystem for AI/ML development (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn). FastAPI is chosen for its high performance, automatic API documentation (Swagger UI), and ease of integrating ML models as microservices, crucial for serving real-time predictions and nudges.

*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** A robust relational database that can efficiently handle structured time-series data (glucose readings, meal logs, medication) and user profiles. Its reliability and support for complex queries are vital for generating personalized insights.

*   **AI/ML Service (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn):** Essential for developing predictive models for glucose level forecasting and identifying patterns that trigger behavioral nudges. Scikit-learn offers algorithms for recommendation systems and classification, while TensorFlow/PyTorch are for deep learning models that can capture complex relationships in user data.

*   **Containerization (Docker & Docker Compose):** Enables consistent development, testing, and deployment environments across different stages, simplifying the management of multiple services (frontend, backend, ML service, database) and ensuring reproducibility.

*   **Wearable Integration:** The backend will be designed with APIs to integrate with major CGM (e.g., Dexcom, Libre) and wearable health platforms (e.g., Google Fit, Apple HealthKit) to aggregate a comprehensive dataset.
